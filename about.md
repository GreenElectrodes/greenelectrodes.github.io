This site is the future home of Green Spark Comics. What is Green Spark Comics, you ask? Well right now, it isn't much of anything. But soon, Green Spark Comics will be the home of Odds 'n' Ends, a short and silly webcomic that will hopefully also be a bit entertaining. In theory, it should be something like a warmup for more exciting comics to come in the future. Odds 'n' Ends is scheduled to launch on September 1, so come back and check it out then!
