Happy Labor Day! Odds 'n' Ends continues strong with comic #2 and its non-punchline.

Back when I first conceived of this project, I felt that it was more important to consistently produce content than to only draw strips that were "funny enough." My strategy was basically this: if I drew one strip every day, eventually ideas for funnier strips would come- I just had to get in the habit of drawing comic strips every day. And this strategy ended up working out, at least to a certain extent. So if you can bear with me a while longer to get through some of these earlier strips, I promise the jokes will get funnier.
